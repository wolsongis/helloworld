# Hello World Webpage Project 

I am a student who is currently learning about GitHub, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Pages through a course called GIS Programming through the University of Florida. This repository contains my first project in this course, a simple "Hello World" webpage. We are exploring the basics of web development and version control. 

## Project Description  

In this project, I:  
- Created a GitHub repository to understand how version control works.  
- Used GitHub Codespaces for editing and writing the HTML code for the webpage.  
- Explored basic HTML and CSS to style the webpage.  
- Published the webpage using GitHub Pages to understand web hosting.  

## Files in the Repository  

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage.  
- `README.md`: This file provides details about the project and the learning process.  

## View the Webpage  

You can view the webpage I created at `https://wolsongis.github.io/helloworld/`.  

## Questions or Issues  

If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll address it as soon as possible.  

Thank you for checking out my first GitHub project!
